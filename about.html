    <span>Access Control System</span>

    Organizations today face a myriad of security challenges at their facilities. Managing the access of authorized personnel into a
    facility is a major concern. The primary challenge for many organizations is to secure their facility from unwanted
    personnel while also allowing a free flow of people who have a legitimate purpose in engaging with the organization. DSS
    Security installs all types of access control systems, from the simplest to the most complex. Access control restricts
    entry into an area by means of electric locks and various entry techniques.
    <h3>Installation of Different Access Control Systems</h3>
    <h4>Electric Locks Installation for Hotels, Factories and Business and Private Sector</h4>
    Electromagnetic locks are rectangular and have two basic parts: the electromagnet and the armature. By code, all
    electromagnetic locks installed are fail-safe (unlocked upon power loss).
    <div class="pro">
    <img src="img/27.png" alt="">
    </div>

  <span>Electric Strikes</span>

    Electric strikes are installed in the strike plate side of the doorjamb can be either fail-safe (unlocked upon power
    loss) or fail-secure (locked upon power loss), depending upon the application.If code requires that the lock installed
    be connected to the fire alarm system, the lock must be fail-safe.
    Because electric strikes do not provide latching of the door upon power loss, they are not allowed by code for
    installation in stairwells.

    <span>Electrified Locksets</span>

    Electrified locksets are locksets that have been modified so that the handle uses power to enable an authorized person
    to enter the protected space. It is used in conjunction with an electrified hinge for power transfer.
